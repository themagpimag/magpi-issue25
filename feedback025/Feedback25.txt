This is a high standard indeed.

Hi Guys,
 
I have just received my Pi and started to play a few days ago, in part because
of your mag.

I was aware of the Pi from other sources, but your mag is a rich source of
info in areas I like

and I am trying to encourage my son (12) to get interested, and my wife (a
Science Teacher)

to also take an active interest.

Love your work guys.


Cheers!
